    Eos is a vibrant, modern world with a fascinating and diverse populous, many of
whom are still called to a life of adventure. While believed to be millions of years older,
the planet Eos’s recorded history stretches back almost 20,000 years from the present
age. While half the world’s population has fled towards growing metropolises like
Brevos or Tanil’i City, the other half still live in the barely tamed wilderness of the
undeveloped world. Scattered across the world are dungeons overflowing with
aberrations and undead; dragons that horde the riches stolen from nearby villages; and
heroes brave (or stupid) enough to face them head on.
