Eos is a vibrant, modern world with a fascinating and diverse populous, many of
whom are still called to a life of adventure. While believed to be millions of years older,
the planet Eos’s recorded history stretches back almost 20,000 years from the present
age. While half the world’s population has fled towards growing metropolises like
Brevos or Tanil’i City, the other half still live in the barely tamed wilderness of the
undeveloped world. Scattered across the world are dungeons overflowing with
aberrations and undead; dragons that horde the riches stolen from nearby villages; and
heroes brave (or stupid) enough to face them head on.</article>

                In the beginning, the universe was nothing but a vast emptiness in the endless
vacuum of space. It is said that at the center of this swirling expanse was an entity
known as Ain Soph, a massive singularity around which this nothingness revolved.
This empty existence displeased the entity, so it split into two beings called Aumaan
and Aram, the first of the Elder Gods. As the two came into existence, the rest of the
singularity dispersed into primordial chaos that soon became the Inner Material
Realms. As Aumaan set out to craft the stars out of these primordial building blocks,
Aram cut a destructive swath through anything Aumaan created. After eons of fighting


back and forth across the universe, the two eventually reached an accord. Aumaan and
their creations would stay in the inner realms, with Aram left to their destructive
tendencies in the outer realms, which radiated with powerful positive and negative
energies.

Aumaan worked swiftly, creating the Elemental realms and the Primordials Titans to
look over them, and at the center of everything they created Genesis, a safe home for

life in a new and unforgiving universe. From the creation of Genesis sprang The All-
Spirit, The Elder Goddess of Life, who gave birth to the first Spirits as well as the other

first Gods, including Solux and Eosa. At the center of this first world was Yggdrasil
the World Tree, a massive tree that connected Genesis with all of creation. Radiating
with Aumaan’s divine power, this tree served initially as a shield to protect it from
Aram’s destructive nature. Eventually the Spirit’s became curious of the outer reaches of
existence. Yggdrasil’s roots began to be used to transport the Spirits to the outer realms
of Positive and Negative Energy, and after prolonged exposure to these energies
changed their natures, the first celestials and fiends were born.

Aram found themself bored razing the outer realms, which had a morphic nature to
it that did not lend well to the euphoric feeling they got from destroying Aumaan’s
material creations. As more and more spirits spread out to the outer realms,
transforming into celestials and fiends, Aram began to corrupte them, fueling non-stop
war across the Realms. While Aram could not travel to Aumaan’s Inner Realms, the
many corrupted spirits could pass freely via the roots of Yggdrasil, eventually spreading
this “First War” to Genesis. The war raged for generations and began to corrupt even the
most innocent denizens of the world. Soon many spirits fled to the outer reaches of
Genesis for safety, but all-out chaos and war had already warped and weakened the
World Tree’s natural defenses. By the time Aumaan had returned from their own godly
realm, they found Aram within a smoking crater, amidst the scattered remains of
Yggdrasil.


The two fought, with Aram severely weakened from expending his power to destroy
the massive world tree. Once Aumaan had subdued the Elder God of Chaos, they grew
the tree Fal’Drassil from the remains of the World Tree and infused it with godly
energy, turning it into a prison for Aram. Aumaan hid this prison, locked away behind a
seal created by the combined power of the four Primordial Titans. With the barrier gone
around the inner realms, the power of the All-Spirit was let loose upon the outer
Realms, spreading life to all corners of existence. Aumaan returned to their once
prosperous creation, with Yggdrasil gone and Genesis scattered into rubble. They
fashioned the remains of Genesis into the Vale of Spirits, but Aumaan could not bring
themself to try and recreate their beloved world, so they instead left this task to Solux
and Eosa, younger Gods who they felt could shape this realm into a place befitting their
vision.
